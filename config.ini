//	Welcome to config.ini. This is your one-stop-shop for small interface tweaks.
//
//	Each section contains a few tweaks that you may choose between. You may only
//	activate one tweak from each section at a time, so please make sure to follow
//	the directions carefully.
//
//	A double slash " // " at the beginning of a line denotes a comment, essentially
//	a line of code that will be ignored by Steam. For each section, choose one tweak
//	you would like to enable and simply remove the // from the beginning of that line.
//	Then YOU MUST add a // to the beginning of each other line in that current section.
//
//	Once you're done, save this file and restart Steam.


	//	Colors
	//	_______

	//	This section will change the focus color of Air.
	//	Please choose one option below and delete the 2 forward slashes " // " at the start of that line.
	//	When you are done, make sure every OTHER line in this section is commented out.

	//	These color themes should operate in the same fashion as the default colors above.
	//	Please only select ONE color between both sections.
	//	If you have an awesome theme that you would like to add, please ping me on the community group!
