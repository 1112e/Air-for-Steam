### Pro Tip™: Keep Air up-to-date via git 

**Windows**
Using the [GitHub](https://windows.github.com) application for Windows  you'll be able to keep the skin up-to-date all the time.

**Mac**
You can install the [GitHub](https://mac.github.com) application to keep the repo in sync without having to return to the site each time.

**LINUX**
If [git](https://git-scm.com/) is installed on your system you can also use that to keep in sync with Air, which will allow you update it more easily. The following guide assumes that git is in your PATH.

1. Install the skin using git
   1. Open up terminal.
   2. Go into your Steam skin folder, by executing the command: `cd ~/.local/share/Steam/skins/`
   3. Make sure you have write permissions in the skin folder and execute the command `git clone https://github.com/Elundris/Air-for-Steam.git`
   4. You may need to "install" the font manually instead by copying it to `/usr/share/fonts` (to install it system-wide) or `~/.fonts` (to install it only for the current user) and executing `fc-cache -fv` in a terminal.
   5. In Steam, open Settings > Interface and select Air as the skin you would like to use. 

2. Update the skin using git
   1. Open up terminal.
   2. `cd` into your Steam skin folder, by executing the command: `cd ~/.local/share/Steam/skins/`
   3. Make sure you have write permissions in the skin folder and execute the command `git pull`
   4. Restart Steam
